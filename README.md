# Advent Of Code 2018

### About
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Because I enjoy both challenges and most anything holiday-related, I am excited to participate in this year's AOC. Although I will not be competing for speed, I'm thrilled to stretch out the brain, you know? These are my solutions to the advent calendar, in Node.js/JavaScript, and are also written as to practice more functional programming.
